# WooCommerce: Full Width Featured Image @ Single Product Page

The standard layout for the WooCommerce single product page features the main/featured product image on the left and the title/add to cart on the right. But what if you need to turn that image into a hero one i.e. a full width featured image, and push the title and add to cart button under it?

Well, for once, we’ll take a look at a CSS-only snippet. Sometimes the easiest things are also the ones that work brilliantly. Enjoy!

Please note – once your featured image goes to full width, it might look pixelated. This is because you’ve likely set a featured image width that is lower than the website full width (“WP Dashboard > Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Images”) and therefore CSS stretches it badly.

# Note:
This code add into style.css in your theme
